							<strong>Maid of Honor: Sara Reisler</strong>
							<br />
							Sara is my best friend, and the only person in the world who I can
							always count on for an honest opinion. I think she has told me I
							was being stupid more than my mom, my roommates, or my future
							husband. In most cases, she has been right, and I have greatly
							benefited from her insights. I am so glad to have her by my side at
							my wedding, and to know that she doesn’t think I am being stupid
							this time.

							<strong>Silke Behrends</strong>
							<br />
							I have known Silke for a very long time, and I am super thrilled
							that she is making the trek from Germany to be in my wedding. I
							cannot remember meeting Silke, but if I did I’m sure I would
							remember an extremely confident, outgoing, super friendly baby
							trying to help a shy, nerdy one come out of its shell. Thanks so
							much to our parents for making sure we kept in touch before we
							were old enough to know how important this would be, and thanks
							to facebook, email, skype, and the like for making being friends
							across an ocean super easy ever since then.
						</p>
						<div class="bridal-divide"></div>
						<img class="bridal-right" src="images/martina.jpg" />
						<p>
							<strong>Martina Hayes</strong>
							<br />
							Somehow I have found a blurb about Martina to be very hard to
							write. Martina is another one of my extremely lucky random
							roommates. She responded to a Craigslist ad and managed not to
							notice how loony we all are during our first meeting. She is
							extremely difficult to capture in a few lines or prose. Thus:
							<br />
							Martina is strange,
							<br />
							reminiscent of myself.
							<br />
							we bake together.
							<br />

						<img class="bridal-left" src="images/ashley.jpg" />
						<p>
							<strong>Ashley McDonald</strong>
							<br />
							Ashley was the world’s best college roommate. We met on move-in
							day hoping that a year with a complete stranger would be passable,
							and have been great friends ever since. I got to be a part of
							Ashley and her husband Ryan’s wedding just a couple of years ago,
							and I always hoped to one day be as happy as she was on that day.
							I also cannot wait to meet their baby boy, who should be appearing
							sometime this summer. Ashley always told me that when you found the
							right person you would just kind of know, and after years of
							doubting her advice I finally believe her.

						<p>
							<strong>Kathryn Schumacher</strong>
							<br />
							As the only bridesmaid in Ann Arbor, Kathryn will be bearing the
							brunt of this wedding planning burden. She is my roommate, my
							office mate, and the center of our social life, so there is no
							escape from my blabber about dresses and cakes and invitation
							lists. So far, we are having a great deal of fun, though overall
							productivity in 1773 IOE has definitely diminished.

						<div class="bridal-divide"></div>
						<img class="bridal-left" src="images/tilly.jpg" />
						<p>
							<strong>Best Man: Billy Teeple</strong>
							<br />
							Billy is one of my oldest friends and a founding member of the Troy
							Halo Organization. From soccer to wrestling to video game
							tournaments, he has been a loyal friend. Despite uncontrollably
							blurting “Go white” whenever he hears the words “Go green,” Billy
							remains my best friend and best man. 
						</p>
						<div class="bridal-divide"></div>
						<img class="bridal-right" src="images/ganish.jpg" />
						<p>
							<strong>Anish Gupta</strong>
							<br />
							Anish is my frat big bra, third year roommate, and 5 time puzzle
							team co-captain. He has been known to make me go running at 6:30am,
							teach kids math, and make sure my mother knows what good children
							she has.
						</p>
						<div class="bridal-divide"></div>
						<img class="bridal-left" src="images/chris.jpg" />
						<p>
							<strong>Chris Chambers</strong>
							<br />
							I’ve been friends with Chris since before elementary school. He
							would usually let me be Indiana Jones while he assumed the less
							glamorous role of Crocodile Dundee as we foraged through the
							jungle-gym wilderness of his back yard.
						</p>
						<div class="bridal-divide"></div>
						<img class="bridal-right" style="margin-right:-20px" src="images/nick.jpg" />
						<p>
							<strong>Billy, Nick Best</strong>
							Nick and Billy are the two humans in the world with DNA most
							similar to mine. For 25 years they’ve tolerated me, covered for me,
							and toughened me up the best they could.

						<strong>Ann Arbor</strong><br />
						<p>
							<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Arbor,_Michigan">Ann Arbor</a> is a fabulous town. Filled with excellent restaurants, great music venues, parks, museums, bodies of water, and students. Below is a list of some of our favorite places and activities, as well as some helpful hints that may help with your wedding attendance logistics. Can’t wait to have you here!
						</p>
						<strong>Restaurants</strong>
						<p><a href="http://cafehabanas.com/ch/annarbor/index.htm">Cafe Habana</a> is one of our favorite restaurants downtown. Specializing in Cuban food and drinks, they also have an exciting lunch menu. The downstairs is a  great place for late-night cocktails, though it can get crowded.</p>
						<p><a href="http://www.zingermansdeli.com/">Zingerman’s</a> is one of Ann Arbor’s foodie gems. This is a fantastic (though overpriced) deli that makes their own cheeses, breads, and meats and sells a variety of high quality products. The sandwiches are fantastic. Seating is next door at the Zingerman’s coffee house, which sells warm drinks and cakes. Across town is Zingerman’s Roadhouse, a more up-scale restaurant that serves full-size entrees.</p>
						<p><a href="http://web.me.com/northsidegrill/NORTHSIDEGRILL/The_Northside_Grill.html">The Northside Grill</a> is our favorite breakfast place. Their specialty is probably their breakfast sandwiches, but even their plain old eggs are great. If you like root beer floats, try theirs. There is often a wait, but it is usually not too long. They also serve you free coffee while you wait.</p>
						<p><a href="http://www.autbar.com/">Aut Bar</a> is a vaguely Italian, gay-friendly restaurant and bar with absolutely awesome food. It has outdoor seating in a really cute little courtyard downtown, and is overall a very pleasant place to have a meal.</p>
						<p><a href="http://www.grizzlypeak.net/">Grizzly Peak</a> is (we think) the best of Ann Arbor’s several brewing companies. The food is quite good, and some of the beers are awesome. If you don’t know what you like, try a beer sampler or just let them you a small taste.</p>
						<p><a href="http://www.gomongo.com/locations/locationDetails.php?loc=1">B.D.’s Mongolian Barbeque</a> is simply fun to go to. Fill a bowl with raw meat, seafood, and veggies, and have one of the chefs cook it up in a variety of sauces on a hot stone. For just a few dollars extra, get the all-you-can-eat option and try all possible combinations.</p>
						<p><a href="http://www.bluenilemi.com/">The Blue Nile</a> serves Ethiopian food, complete with straw tables and a good amount of spice. Their sampler platters are all-you-can-eat, so just pick your favorite dishes and they will keep bringing more. However, we have yet to manage to eat more than the first plate full.</p>
						<p>I mention <a href="http://www.buffalowildwings.com/">Buffalo Wild Wings</a> only because this is where we had out first date. The wings are great (our favorites are the hot and spicy garlic varieties).</p>
						<p><a href="http://www.muer.com/">The Gandy Dancer</a> is Ann Arbor’s fanciest restaurant. It is located in the old train station, so don’t freak out when the train rolls by halfway though the soup course. We have not actually eaten here, so let us know if you’re going and feel like inviting the bride and groom.</p>
						<p><a href="http://heidelbergannarbor.com/">The Heidelberg</a> is Ann Arbor’s token German restaurant. It has pretty mediocre food, but the beer selection is excellent, so stop in for a real Weissbier.</p>
						<strong>Bars</strong>
						<p>If you want to sit outside for a drink, you should go to <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/dominicks-ann-arbor">Dominick’s</a>. This tiny place has a lot of outdoor seating and very very good sangria served in old jam jars. Note that the place closes early since it is in a neighborhood.</p>
						<p><a href="http://www.ashleys.com/">Ashley’s</a> is a fantastic beer bar, with an unbeatable selection. The atmostphere is also nice. Do watch out for crowds, but if you have a bit of patience you can almost surely get a seat.<p>
						<p>Several other good bar choices are listed in the restaurant section, such as Cafe Habana and Heidelberg, so check these out as well.</p>
						<strong>Entertainment/Things to do</strong><br />
						<p>There are three main parts of downtown Ann Arbor, all of which are worth a walk around. <a href="http://www.a2state.com/">State Street</a> is the heart of student life, with a large number of bars, eateries, and shops usually filled with Michigan students. For a more grown-up feel, try walking down <a href="http://mainstreetannarbor.org/">Main Street</a>, which hosts more up-scale dining, bars, and music venues. Finally, there is the somewhat alternative <a href="http://kerrytown.org/">Kerrytown</a> (that’s where we live!). Of course it is also worth it to take a look at central campus of the <a href="http://www.umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>, located just south-east of downtown.</p>
